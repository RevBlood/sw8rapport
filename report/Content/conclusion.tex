The final product has turned out somewhat functional. it is able to provide suggestions based on users preferences and allows for easily obtained information about nearby stores and retailers. The problem statement described in \ref{sec:probstate} has in the clearest meaning been solved as the application is able to provide suggestions based on the preferences set by the specific user. It is however not ideal that the only preference to set at this given moment is monetary. The application could be greatly improved by having support for more preferences with more diversity so the target group could be broadened. We have as mentioned made it possible for each user to determine what the ideal radius for shopping is for them - this is perfect for fitting all target groups when it comes to means of transportation, whether by car, walking or other.

It should be noted that while serving recommendations are completely possible, the final product suffers greatly from a lack of data. At this point there are no available recipes unless entered manually, ingredients only from offers and statistics, and this makes it hard to actually make good recommendations.

The server has been developed with performance in mind. We have intentionally created some suboptimal spacial entities with the purpose of creating faster queries. The server does however spend some time making the calculations depending on how many recipes are in the database. \fixme{skriv til backend/servershit}

The application is also unfinished although runnable. It could most definitely use some polishing and new graphics, as the graphics currently used are purely android studio sprites. \fixme{more shit about the frontend/android shitthing}. There are both unfinished components, visuals and elements that needs refinement. It is however able to provide an intuitive way of getting recommendations through ones own preferences, along with browsing the contents of a recipe.
