\section{Problem statement}
\label{sec:probstate}

With the mentioned examples, it is clear that there is a lot of different applications within the field, but all with different purposes. What seems to be lacking, is an application that focuses on having maybe a smaller recipe database, but takes prices or other preferences into consideration. With this in mind the problem statement for this project will be the following: \\


\emph{How can we develop a recipe application with the ability to recommend recipes based on a certain set of preferences} \\


Furthermore the application will be mainly focused on students, and therefore the preferences will be mainly focused on price. This raises some further requirements for the application. It has to be used by customers while they are on the go, and give fast and appropriate results.

\begin{itemize}
\item The application should be focused mainly on price and savings.
\item The application should only take nearby convenient stores and retailers into consideration.
\item Recommendations have to be calculated on a server, in order to provide quick results.
\item The server has to be designed with performance in mind over storage.
\end{itemize}
