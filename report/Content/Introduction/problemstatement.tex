\section{Problemstatement}
\label{sec:probstate}

With all the before mentioned info, it is clear that there is a lot of different application all with different purposes. What is lacking is an application that focuses on having maybe a smaller recipe database, but takes prices or other preferences into consideration.

\emph{How can we develop a recipe application with the ability to recommend recipes based on a certain set of preferences}

Furthermore the application will be mainly focused on students therefore the preferences will be mainly focused on price. This raises some further requirements for the application. It has to used by customers while they are on the go, and give fast and appropriate results.

\begin{itemize}
\item The application should be focused mainly on price and savings.
\item The application should only take nearby convenient stores and retailers into consideration.
\item The calculations have to be made on a server, in-order to give fast results.
\item The server has to be designed with performance in mind over storage.
\end{itemize}
