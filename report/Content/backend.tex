\label{chap:backend}

The backend has been designed and implemented following an agile development style. We followed the iterative and incremental development (IID) style, which we have had good success with previously. This style works well for small, self-organizing teams with experienced developers. The nature of modern software development tend to be a misfit for the waterfall method, whereas IID implements small features on an iterative basis, allowing for continuous customer interaction and rapid communication regarding changes. The concept ensures that the developer and the customer learn about the software solution together and both contribute with valuable changes throughout the entire process. 

In this project we acted as our own customers, which means we did the prioritizing and decision making ourselves.

The backend functionality is developed in Microsoft's \textit{Visual Studio}\cite{visualstudio} using the programming language C\#. The database is developed using \textit{PostgreSQL}\cite{postgreSQL}.
