\subsection{Alternatives}
\label{subsec:restAlt}
An alternative to REST is the more extensive web service called Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). SOAP is based on the XML-format and the protocol consist of three parts: an envelope that defines the message structure and how this is used, encoding rules, and how to call procedures and responses\cite{DecidingOnRESTful}. SOAP has power over RESTful because it is protocol independent, and it offers a larger range of protocols to work with. RESTful only works with HTTP, whereas SOAP may use HTTP, SMTP, TCP, and UDP. Naturally, when a web service wants to allow a wide range of choices, complexity follows with it. Because a project like this is limited by resources, we decided to go with the ad-hoc advised web service type that RESTful provides, instead of the more complex SOAP\cite{DecidingOnRESTful}.
