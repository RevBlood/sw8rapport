\subsection{Implementation of the Models}\label{subsec:implementationmodels}
The error-checking and handling is not implemented in this project because we valued more functionality over this. In the code for each model there exist a get- and setter but it has not been implemented further. In this project, most error-handling and data-structure checking is handled on the Frontend, see chapter \ref{chap:frontend}.
