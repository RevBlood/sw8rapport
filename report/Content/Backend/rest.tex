\section{RESTful Web Service}
\label{sec:rest}

This section is about the communication between the application and the server. It entails a description of REST overall and how it is directly related to our program and the demands we have, and why we have chosen it compared to the also popular choice SOAP. A detailed description of the implementation of REST we have chosen, will also be described.
