The project is on the subject of a recommendation system for proposing recipes for hungry students. The goal of the project is to create an application that can suggest recipes that fit the preferences of the user. The user should get the nearby stores in which is it possible to buy the ingredients for the dish - and even get an estimate on cost and savings in the given store. The recommendations system and the database is located on a local server, while the application visible for the users is in the form of an android application. The final application is fully functional but the database lacks recipe data, so the suggestions are not as fitted as they could be. The amount of ingredient data is decent, it does however entail some false information that has not been handled well. The communication between server and applications works as intended, but the entire project needs more work before it could be applicable to the real world.
