\section*{Reading guide}
The report is clearly divided into frontend and backend sections. The backend represents the server while the frontend represents the applications. These two sections can be read individually while the conclusion and the test is highly dependent on having read the entire report.

The program code is on the disc attached. The program code is compilable but it requires a lot of setup on both database and information gathering, this is why do not advice you try to get the entire server running with full database and information. We recommend you spend the time reading the code referenced in the report, and understand it from a theoretical standpoint.
